Feature: Crediting
  There are two ways to get voting power:
  * "Buy" votes by donating to the OpenCollective
  * "Earn" votes by being active on GitHub

  Rules
  =====
  * One vote for each day since first commit to repo

#  Scenario: @aslakhellesoy is credited for days
#    Given @aslakhellesoy exists
#    And @aslakhellesoy has been a committer for 300 days
#    When @aslakhellesoy is credited for committer days
#    Then @aslakhellesoy should have 300 votes left
